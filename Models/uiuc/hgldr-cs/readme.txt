CS Airwave Xtreme 150 Hang Glider
3D Model by Captain Slug (captainslg@aol.com)
Originally created for MSFS 98
Original file probably hgldr_98.zip

The transparent sail trailing edge appears to be a little buggy when
viewed.  This is probably due to some error in the conversion from
Microsoft MDL format to FGFS.

Permission granted to use and release with FlightGear under the 
GNU GPL (MSS 11/8/2002).

Hi "Captain Slug",

You might be interested in knowing that I have used your hang glider
model in my work Flightgear (http://www.flightgear.org).  I developed
the aerodynamic model and your 3D model is used for the external view.

Here are the files that I am using:
hgldr_cs.0af
hgldr_cs.1af
hgldr_cs.mdl

And these end up looking like the hang glider here:
http://home.t-online.de/home/Wolfram.Kuss/Gliders/Gliders.htm

My question is could I have your permission to include your 3D model
w/ the Flightgear distribution (open source under the GPL).  To
include the model w/ Flightgear means that it would carry the GPL
license.  The GPL license is what has brought the world linux --- a
good thing.

I would include whatever credits you like.

Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Michael

Sure, but I have a newer version (which I have attached to this
e-mail).  You can use any of my models if you want.  I have a list of
every aircraft I've made if you want to take a look.
